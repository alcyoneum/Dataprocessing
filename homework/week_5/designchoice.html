            <h2> The reason behind the design </h2>

            <h3> Map of Europe </h3>
            <p> The Better Life index is an interesting dataset that allows you 
                to compare well-being across countries. The reason I chose to
                draw a map is because a map is a very clear way to visualize 
                variables per country. I decided to zoom in on Europe, because
                data was available for almost all countries in Europe, while 
                data from countries in other continents was limited. I thought
                it interesting to see how life satisfaction and life expectancy
                is distributed in Europe, which is why I chose these two
                variables. The countries are coloured green based on their life
                satisfaction score and life expectancy. The darker the color
                the "better" the score or expectancy. I designed the buckets
                for the data to fill the countries, such that there are three 
                classes: low, middle, high. The reason to do three buckets and 
                not more was to keep it clear.
            </p>

            <h3> The bar chart </h3>
            <p> The bar chart contains three well-being indicators: employment
                rate, educational attainment, and self-reported health. I 
                thought it was interesting to see how these three relate to 
                each other. Does high educational attainment cause a high 
                employment rate? Does high employment rate cause low 
                self-reported health? A bar chart would make it easy to compare 
                their relationship with eachother. I decided to do three 
                indicators so that is was easy to keep the overview and because 
                all three the indicators have the same scale on the y-axis 
                ( % of population).

            <h3> Interaction between map and bar chart </h3>
            <p> Personally, I think the interaction between the map and the bar 
                chart is the most interesting one. I was curious to know which 
                indicators might influence life satisfaction and life expectancy
                per country. So that is why I designed the map so that when a 
                country is clicked, it will update the bar chart according to 
                the country.
            </p>

            <h3> Overall design of the website </h3>
            <p> I tried to keep everything clear and simple. The index page with
                the visualization is divided in three parts: the buttons where 
                you can update the map, the map of europe, and the bar chart. 
                An interaction with one part, will lead to an update to the other. 
                A navigation bar on top also divides the visualization from the 
                data. As might be noticed, the general theme color is green.
                This color was chosen, because green is often associated with 
                energy, growth, and harmony. This is perfect because it shows 
                you data about life! </p>
