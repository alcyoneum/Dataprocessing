            <h2> The story behind the data </h2>

            <p> The Better Life Index allows you to compare well-being across 
                countries, measuring several well-being indicators. The life 
                satisfaction score evaluates how people see their life as a 
                whole. It is based on the Cantril Ladder that rates people's 
                life satisfaction on a scale from 0 to 10. Life expectancy 
                measures how long average people are expected to live based on 
                age-specific death rates that are prevailing. What are possible 
                qualities in a country that can influence either life 
                satisfaction or life expectancy? This visualization shows three 
                qualities: employment rate, educational attainment, and 
                self-reported health.
            </p>

            <p> The employment rate in a country is the percentage of the working-age
                (16-64 years) population. Is it possible that employed people 
                are more satisfied with their life than those who are not 
                employed? And how does employment rate relate to life expectancy? 
                Is your life expectancy lower when you are unemployed, 
                because it is harder to support yourself?
            </p>

            <p> The educational attainment is the percentage of the adult 
                population (25-64 years) holding at least an upper secondary 
                degree. Are people more satisfied with their life when holding 
                a degree? Is life expectancy lower when educational attainment 
                is high, because studying is stressful?
            </p>

            <p> The self-reported health is the percentage of the population 
                aged 15 years and older who reported their health as good in 
                general. Are people more satisfied with their life when they 
                feel healthy? Is life expectancy high when self-reported health 
                is high as well?
            </p>

            <p> The visualization will show you some interesting and unexpected results! </p>
